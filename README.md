# ZanelesProjects
My first few projects.
My name is Zanele Maseko. I have been coding since February 2023. I have learned the basics of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Python. 
I have produced a few projects by myself to test and improve my coding skills.
I am currently teaching myself and using resources at my disposal like free online courses through udacity, freecodecamp, and, lewagon.
