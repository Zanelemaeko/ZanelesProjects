# ZanelesProjects
My first few projects.
My name is Zanele Maseko and I am a 20-year-old male. I have been coding for 6 months( since February 2023) and these are the first few projects that I have produced on my own.
Since graduating high school I have not been able to study further so I turned to the next best thing and used resources at my disposal like YouTube and Google to learn the basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
